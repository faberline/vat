# Source TD: projects/vat/src/cli.rs

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

Public API manifest for `projects/vat/src/cli.rs` generated from AST during Score force-regeneration standardization.

## Source
<!-- type: source lang: rust -->

`````rust
//! CLI surface.
//!
//! Verbs are deliberately few and composable, because the operator is an
//! agent, not a human juggling a dashboard. The defaults that matter for an
//! agent — JSON state, forwarded exit codes, copy-on-write disposability — are
//! the *unflagged* path. The README carries the tradeoff rationale for where
//! vat departs from Docker's human-dev ergonomics.
