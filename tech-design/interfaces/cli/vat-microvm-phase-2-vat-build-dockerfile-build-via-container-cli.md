id: vat-microvm-phase-2-vat-build-dockerfile-build-via-container-cli
summary: Add `vat build`, a CLI command wrapping Apple's `container build` (real BuildKit, confirmed by the Phase 0 spike #1472) to build a tagged local OCI image from an existing, unmodified Dockerfile. #1529 factors its in-process build primitive into a runtime-selected image-store contract for `vat compose`: `auto`, `native`, and `docker` build into Docker; `microvm` builds into Apple Container. The public `vat build` command remains Apple-Container-backed. Phase 2 of the microVM epic (#1471); Phase 1 (#1474, merged) added `Isolation::MicroVm` for `vat run`.

    claim: vat-build-dockerfile-build-via-container-cli
    coverage: full
    rationale: "Adds commands/build.rs (Args/BuildReport, exec(), build_image(), container_build_command(), ensure_microvm_available()), the Cmd::Build CLI variant, the additive sandbox/microvm.rs system_up()/ensure_system_started() probes, and the serde_yaml unconditional-dependency promotion. #1529 adds the private ImageBuilder mapping, Docker argv/probe, and build_image_with_builder() path that lets compose build and later run from one local image store."

  build_args_struct:
    type: object
    description: "New apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs struct Args: file: Option<PathBuf> (defaults to `Dockerfile` inside the resolved context dir), context: Option<PathBuf> (defaults to the current directory), tag: Option<String> (defaults to `<context-dir-basename>:latest`, sanitized to a valid OCI reference — lowercased, non [a-z0-9._-] runs collapsed to `-` — resolved once in exec() before any subprocess is spawned; build_image() itself never guesses a tag, it always receives a concrete &str), build_args: Vec<(String,String)> (one pair per repeated --build-arg K=V flag, parsed via split_once('='), CLI-supplied order preserved — no BTreeMap reordering needed here since the input is already a deterministic Vec, unlike Phase 1's EnvSpec.env map), json: bool."
  build_report_struct:
    type: object
    description: "New apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs struct BuildReport (derives serde::Serialize): tag: String, dockerfile: String (resolved absolute path), context: String (resolved absolute path), build_args: BTreeMap<String,String> (sorted for deterministic JSON field ordering in the report, independent of the argv-ordering rule above), duration_ms: u64. Constructed only on a successful build — the selected builder's Result<BuildReport> Err variant covers every failure path (missing Dockerfile, unavailable store, nonzero build exit); there is no success:false variant."
  container_build_command_fn:
    type: object
    description: "New apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs fn container_build_command(dockerfile: &Path, tag: &str, build_args: &[(String,String)], context: &Path) -> Vec<String>. Pure, deterministic argv builder (no subprocess, no I/O) producing exactly: [\"container\", \"build\", \"-f\", <dockerfile>, \"-t\", <tag>, \"--build-arg\", \"K=V\", ... one --build-arg pair per entry in the given slice order ..., <context>] (R2), matching the real invocation Phase 0 verified (`container build -f \"$WORKDIR/Dockerfile\" -t vat-spike-test:latest \"$WORKDIR\"`). Unlike sandbox/microvm.rs's resolve() (which returns a (program, argv) tuple), this fn returns the program name (\"container\") as argv[0] itself."
  image_builder_mapping:
    type: object
    description: "apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs ImageBuilder maps ServiceRuntime::Auto, ::Native, and ::Docker to Docker, and ::MicroVm to Apple Container. resolve_image_builder(runtime) performs this mapping and proves the chosen store is usable before compose may build or materialize a generated vat.toml. The mapping intentionally mirrors image-service dispatch so an image cannot be built in one local store and started from another."
  build_image_fn:
    type: object
    description: "apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs fn build_image(context, dockerfile, tag, build_args) -> Result<BuildReport> remains the in-process Apple-Container entry point for the public `vat build` surface. It resolves MicroVm and delegates to build_image_with_builder(), preserving Phase 2's captured-output behavior."
  build_image_with_builder_fn:
    type: object
    description: "apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs fn build_image_with_builder(builder, context, dockerfile, tag, build_args) -> Result<BuildReport> is compose's in-process primitive. It revalidates the Dockerfile, invokes the already-preflighted Docker or Apple Container argv with captured stdout/stderr, and returns the concrete tag/path/args report. Compose never shells out to the vat binary."
  docker_build_command_fn:
    type: object
    description: "Private docker_build_command() mirrors container_build_command() exactly except argv[0] is `docker`. Docker and Apple Container have independent local image stores, so the identical flag shape is not permission to substitute one command for the other."
  ensure_docker_builder_available_fn:
    type: object
    description: "Private ensure_docker_builder_available() runs a bounded two-second `docker info` probe. Missing Docker, a nonzero probe, or a timeout is a fail-closed compose-import error with explicit remediation; import must not hang before materialization."
  ensure_microvm_available_fn:
    type: object
    description: "New apps/vat/src/commands/build.rs fn ensure_microvm_available() -> Result<()>, mirroring run.rs's ensure_docker_available: requires sandbox::microvm::available() (container binary on PATH); if sandbox::microvm::system_up() is not immediately true, waits via sandbox::microvm::ensure_system_started(<bounded timeout>) before failing. Fail-closed and clean — never auto-installs the container CLI, never silently proceeds without a responsive system."
  microvm_system_up_fn:
    type: object
    description: "New additive apps/vat/src/sandbox/microvm.rs fn: pub fn system_up() -> bool. Bounded-timeout `container system status` probe (spawn with stdout/stderr to null, short internal timeout, return status.success()), mirroring run.rs's docker_daemon_up(). Additive only — no change to MicroVmBackend, resolve(), or available() (Phase 1, untouched)."
  microvm_ensure_system_started_fn:
    type: object
    description: "New additive apps/vat/src/sandbox/microvm.rs fn: pub fn ensure_system_started(timeout: Duration) -> Result<(), String>. Poll+timeout loop (Instant::now() deadline, short sleep between polls of system_up()) mirroring cluster.rs's run_capture() poll pattern; returns Err naming the elapsed timeout when the container system never reports up within the bound. Additive only, same non-interference guarantee as system_up() above."
  cargo_serde_yaml_promotion:
    type: object
    description: "apps/vat/Cargo.toml: serde_yaml (version 0.9, unchanged) loses `optional = true` and becomes an unconditional dependency; removed from the `emulator` feature's `dep:serde_yaml` list. Zero new crate, needed unconditionally ahead of Phase 3's compose YAML parsing (not used by this WI's own code)."
additionalProperties: true
```
## Config
<!-- type: config lang: yaml -->

```yaml
files:
  - path: apps/vat/Cargo.toml
    changes:
      - "serde_yaml dependency (version 0.9, unchanged) loses `optional = true` and becomes an unconditional dependency of the vat crate."
      - "serde_yaml is removed from the `emulator` feature's `dep:` list (it stops being feature-gated); the emulator feature retains its other deps unchanged."
    rationale: >
      R5: Phase 3's `vat compose` will parse a compose YAML file unconditionally
      (not behind the emulator feature), and this WI is the point in the
      rollout where that dependency shift is made — ahead of Phase 3 actually
      using it. Zero new crate: serde_yaml is already vendored/locked at 0.9
      from the emulator feature today, so this is a Cargo.toml-only edit with
      no Cargo.lock churn beyond the feature-unification.
    verification: >
      AC6: `cargo build -p vat` (default features) and
      `cargo build -p vat --no-default-features` both succeed after the
      promotion — the lean, no-default-features build must still compile
      cleanly now that serde_yaml is unconditional.
no_new_config_keys: true
notes: >
  vat build introduces no new vat.toml configuration key and no new
  environment variable. All new behavior is CLI-flag-driven
  (--file/--context/--tag/--build-arg/--json on `vat build`, see the CLI
  section) plus the two additive sandbox/microvm.rs probe functions, which
  take their bounded timeout as a plain Duration argument from the caller
  (ensure_microvm_available in commands/build.rs), not from a config file.
```
## CLI
<!-- type: cli lang: yaml -->

```yaml
commands:
  - name: vat build
    usage: "vat build [--file <path>] [--context <dir>] [--tag <ref>] [--build-arg K=V]... [--json]"
    new_cmd_variant: "Cmd::Build { file: Option<PathBuf>, context: Option<PathBuf>, tag: Option<String>, build_arg: Vec<String>, json: bool }"
    dispatch: "cli.rs routes Cmd::Build to commands::build::exec(Args { .. })"
    behavior:
      - "--file defaults to `Dockerfile` inside the resolved --context directory when omitted."
      - "--context defaults to the current working directory when omitted; both --file and --context are resolved to absolute paths before any other step."
      - "--tag defaults to `<context-dir-basename>:latest` (sanitized to a valid OCI reference: lowercased, non [a-z0-9._-] runs collapsed to `-`) when omitted; this default is resolved once in exec() — build_image() itself always receives a concrete tag: &str and never guesses."
      - "--build-arg K=V may be repeated; each occurrence parses into a (String,String) pair via split_once('='); CLI-supplied order is preserved into the argv builder (no reordering)."
      - "The public `vat build` surface resolves ServiceRuntime::MicroVm and calls resolve_image_builder() before execution (fail-closed): it requires the `container` binary on PATH and a responsive system (system_up(), or a bounded ensure_system_started() wait)."
      - "Human mode (json=false): exec() spawns the selected standalone Apple-Container argv directly with inherited stdio, so live BuildKit layer/cache progress streams to the terminal in real time (R3); on success prints a one-line tag + elapsed-time summary."
      - "JSON mode (json=true): exec() calls build_image() (captured stdout/stderr, never echoed) and prints only the structured BuildReport as JSON on success; this is an intentional divergence from gc.rs's compute-then-report pattern because build progress has real value and no other vat command proxies a long-running streamed subprocess today (R3)."
      - "AC5: vat build never edits, lints, or otherwise mutates the Dockerfile it is given — it only reads the path and passes it to `container build -f`; works unmodified against any existing repo Dockerfile."
      - "The public command remains Apple-Container-backed. #1529 adds a private compose-only Docker builder for ServiceRuntime::Auto|Native|Docker and a private Apple-Container builder for ServiceRuntime::MicroVm; it does not alter Isolation::MicroVm's resolve() argv shape or pick()'s fail-closed branch."
      - "Out of scope for this command: compose YAML parsing and registry push/pull. Compose owns canonical source-relative path resolution, tags, args, and its import transaction; it calls the selected in-process primitive only after that contract is established."
  - name: "vat run / vat capabilities / vat doctor (unaffected)"
    usage: "(no change)"
    behavior:
      - "Not modified by this WI: no changes to Isolation::MicroVm's resolve() argv shape, pick()'s fail-closed branch, capabilities.rs, or doctor.rs. `container build` reuses the same `container` CLI presence check family (sandbox::microvm::available()) but is otherwise independent of the `vat run` code path."
