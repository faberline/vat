# Vat Local Agent Test Runner Protocol

## Scenarios
<!-- type: scenarios lang: yaml -->

```yaml
id: vat-local-agent-test-runner-protocol-scenarios
scenarios:
  - id: config_runner_success_cleans_up
    given:
      - "a project contains vat.toml with one runner that requires one local service"
      - "the service reaches its configured HTTP readiness endpoint"
    when:
      - "an agent runs `vat run e2e --json`"
    then:
      - "vat creates a copy-on-write workspace for the run"
      - "vat starts the required service only for the duration of the run"
      - "vat executes the selected runner command"
      - "vat emits structured JSON with runner, service, log, artifact, diff, and cleanup metadata"
      - "successful runs use the default failed-only retention policy and remove retained workspace state after emitting the result"
      - "each Vat::save atomically replaces meta.json through a unique sibling temporary file, write, sync_all, and rename, so a concurrent compose reconciler can observe only a complete metadata revision"
  - id: failed_runner_keeps_evidence
    given:
      - "a vat.toml runner exits non-zero"
    when:
      - "the agent runs the named runner"
    then:
      - "vat forwards the runner exit code"
      - "vat keeps the vat directory, logs, artifact list, and diff evidence"
      - "`vat state <id>`, `vat logs <id> runner`, and `vat diff <id>` remain useful for diagnosis"
  - id: service_readiness_timeout_terminates_run
    given:
      - "a runner requires a service with ready_http"
      - "the service never becomes ready before timeout_s"
    when:
      - "vat waits for service readiness"
    then:
      - "the run fails with a readiness timeout"
      - "vat terminates all service process groups"
      - "failure evidence is retained according to the failed-only policy"
  - id: occupied_owned_native_endpoint_fails_closed
    given:
      - "a command-backed native service declares a literal 127.0.0.1 endpoint already served by an unrelated listener"
    when:
      - "vat prepares the owned service and waits for readiness"
    then:
      - "vat rejects the exact service and endpoint before spawning the owned child"
      - "vat does not start dependent runners or kill the unrelated listener"
      - "only an explicit external service may attach to an existing listener"
      - "localhost, IPv6 loopback, and other non-literal loopback readiness hosts are rejected because they cannot share the exact 127.0.0.1 reservation proof"
      - "auto ports remain reserved for the run through preparation and are released immediately at the owned-child spawn boundary"
      - "after spawn, readiness requires the endpoint to transition from unavailable to reachable while the owned child remains live"
  - id: unconfirmed_runtime_cleanup_forces_retention
    given:
      - "a runner or scenario has a VAT-owned Docker or MicroVM service"
      - "the final docker rm -f or container rm -f teardown fails or times out and cannot be proven absent by a successful exact-name bounded list query"
      - "workspace.keep is never or failed"
    when:
      - "the runner or scenario lifecycle reaches finalization"
    then:
      - "vat emits microvm_cleanup_unconfirmed and returns a nonzero lifecycle result"
      - "vat retains its state, logs, artifacts, diff evidence, persisted runtime name, and cleanup_error despite the normal keep policy"
      - "a nonzero rm -f is considered auto-removal only when its exact-name list query succeeds and reports no match: Docker uses container ls -a with an anchored name filter and exact line comparison; MicroVM uses container list --all --format json with no matching id. Query error, timeout, malformed JSON, or a live resource remains unconfirmed"
      - "a later compose down retries only the recorded Docker or MicroVM resource; Kubernetes cluster deletion remains deferred to its own phase"
  - id: direct_command_mode_stays_compatible
    given:
      - "an existing caller uses `vat run -- <cmd>`"
    when:
      - "the caller runs a direct command"
    then:
      - "vat does not require vat.toml"
      - "vat preserves current foreground stdio behavior"
      - "vat forwards the child command exit code"
  - id: signal_interrupt_finalizes_owned_groups
    given:
      - "a direct or configured vat run owns TERM-resistant runner/service leaders and descendants in private process groups"
      - "an explicit external service or unrelated listener remains outside VAT ownership"
    when:
      - "VAT receives SIGINT or SIGTERM followed by any later signal"
    then:
      - "the first signal remains authoritative and the signal handler only records/wakes"
      - "the run thread finalizes runners first and VAT-owned services in reverse start order"
      - "each owned group receives TERM, bounded grace, KILL when necessary, leader reap, and PGID-absence proof exactly once"
      - "VAT persists terminal interrupted state with exact signal/reason and no live child PID only after cleanup"
      - "VAT exits 130 for SIGINT or 143 for SIGTERM and retains the evidence regardless of keep policy"
      - "external services and unrelated listeners are never signalled"

        A run-scoped dependency service. It is backed by exactly one of: cmd
        (an explicit native command), preset (a built-in service whose runtime

        image (an OCI service such as AlloyDB, which requires container_port).

        declared OCI route must pass bounded Apple image inspect/pull/verify
        preflight. The runner that requires the service is always a host process

## Manifest
<!-- type: manifest lang: yaml -->

```yaml
manifests:

    changes:
      - "Add TOML parsing dependency for vat.toml."

## Runtime Image
<!-- type: runtime-image lang: yaml -->

```yaml
images: []
build_contexts: []
x-aw-contract:
  surface: none
  reason: >
    Vat ships no image and builds none. It may run a run-scoped dependency
    service as an ephemeral `docker run` or explicit Apple `container run`
    container (a preset/image with the selected runtime), but it is not an image
    registry/builder and the runner is always a host process.
```

## Deployment

# Reviews

### Review 1
**Verdict:** approved

- [scenarios] The TD captures the intended ephemeral agent test runner lifecycle, including success cleanup, failed evidence retention, service readiness timeout, and direct-run compatibility.
- [config] The `vat.toml` schema is intentionally small and project-local, with `workspace`, `env`, `setup`, `services`, and `runners` only.
- [logic] The orchestration flow keeps services run-scoped and explicitly avoids daemon or long-lived process management.
- [changes] The implementation scope is bounded to vat config loading, run orchestration, state evidence, logs, README, manifest, and tests.
