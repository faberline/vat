      - "one five-second bounded isolated observer governs root exit and both pipe EOFs; stdout and stderr each retain at most 256 KiB; valid JSON with a nonzero child exit preserves that status, while malformed, oversized, or escaped-pipe capture suppresses raw stdout"

    then:
      - "VAT requires exactly one format and one timeout in either order before one safe id, requires SECONDS in 1..=1200 and a nonempty command after the Docker-facing literal --, and leaves unformatted/raw exec on the inherited generic path"
      - "VAT removes its selectors and Docker-only delimiter, invokes only container exec CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...], and emits exactly one vat.docker.exec.v1/vat_json wrapper with host-container-client-observation timeout scope, bounded untrusted stdout/stderr suffixes, child outcome, and a safe inspect next"
      - "ordinary child nonzero preserves wrapper plus exit; timeout or setup/capture failure emits no partial wrapper; both streams drain concurrently and each serialized JSON string is capped at 64 KiB"
      - "the timeout bounds only VAT's host Apple Container client observation and makes no guest-command termination claim; TTY, interactive, detach, env/user/workdir, templates, duplicate/misordered selectors, malformed delimiters, and all other exec flags fail before runtime"

It also rejects detach, TTY, interactive, caller name/label, ports, network, mounts, env, and every other run option before Apple Container starts"
      - "VAT creates a high-entropy name plus independent owner label, captures bounded stdout/stderr, and emits one vat.docker.run.v1/vat_json document only after exact owner-label cleanup confirms absence"
      - "ordinary child nonzero preserves wrapper plus exit only after confirmed cleanup; timeout, setup, or cleanup uncertainty emits no partial wrapper; only Apple's explicit Error: container not found: <name> diagnostic proves an already-absent generated container"
      - "the timeout is host Apple Container client observation only; the one-shot makes no guest-wide termination, crash-recovery cleanup, Docker Engine parity, or secret-redaction claim"

      - "the receipt marks image_lifecycle=retained_no_auto_cleanup and has bounded untrusted streams with truncation/lossy flags, timeout scope, and child outcome; success has strict image-inspect next, while ordinary child failure retains receipt/exit but is terminal build_failed with docker --help rather than stale image inspect"
      - "timeout, setup, or capture failure emits no receipt. The deadline is host Apple Container client observation only: it makes no cancellation, rollback/removal, Docker Engine/API, provenance, ownership, readiness, security, or secret-redaction claim"
      - "host-test cleanup is not product behavior: a high-entropy tag and exact io.cclab.vat.e2e-owner label need exact native absence before build, owner-label recheck before delete, and exact absence after; Apple has no conditional build/delete, so best-effort races leak on ambiguity"

      - "VAT strips only JSON/deadline selectors, invokes public `container image pull IMAGE`, then emits one bounded vat.docker.pull.v1/vat_json receipt after the client exits"
      - "the receipt has bounded untrusted streams, truncation/lossy flags, timeout scope, and child outcome with image_lifecycle=not_owned_no_auto_cleanup: the image is shared, no VAT cleanup or ownership exists, and VAT implements no registry login/auth/credential lifecycle"
      - "success has strict image-inspect next without image-state/download-completion proof; ordinary child failure retains receipt/exit but is terminal pull_failed with docker --help rather than stale inspect; timeout, setup, capture, or pipe failure emits no receipt"
      - "the deadline observes only the host client and copied pipes: it makes no transfer cancellation, download-completion, rollback, local/backend image-state, Docker Engine/API, registry-management, provenance, digest, platform, freshness, ownership, security, or secret-redaction claim"

      - "Use typed vat compose import/up with runtime=microvm, record the selected profile, then emit vat_docker_compose with next=docker compose -p PROJECT ps. Host-facing JSON includes profile=host-facing-independent-v1, service_name_dns=false, and host_loopback_only=true."
      - "Keep detached mode explicit: accept --wait at most once; accept --wait-timeout only with wait as positive whole seconds (default 300, maximum 1200). Start the budget after validated import and any source build, immediately before detached launch; it covers handoff plus durable VAT runner/topology observations, not Docker healthchecks, application HTTP, service DNS, or generic Compose."
      - "Pin observation to the selected profile, generation, and ticket while releasing the registry lock between polls. Ready returns one final up JSON with wait plus ready topology.

      - "Capture the validated document and route it once to the typed MicroVM Compose import/build/up path so source replacement cannot bypass the strict profile and build/run use the same Apple image store."
      - "On successful non-wait up, emit only the exact VAT-built images array and cleanup_next=docker compose down plus docker image rm for that tag; literal-image up never claims image ownership. With wait, cleanup_next is emitted only in the verified ready final result."

      - "Accept only the exact no-argument ps shape; Docker --format and every other ps flag fail before observation."
      - "Route only a record carrying a known shim profile to a typed, claim-held VAT Compose observation. Generic, missing, and unknown shim provenance fail closed before inspection or topology output."
      - "Preserve the human-readable ps text and end with additive vat_docker_compose JSON carrying the known profile plus topology { phase, ready, services }, whose service entries carry name/state and an optional endpoint."
      - "Use registered service-ID order. Endpoint fields are canonical 127.0.0.1:<port> strings and appear for every service only after every expected service has unique Ready VAT-owned container_run evidence for its exact MicroVM, a nonzero loopback port, and no cleanup error."
      - "If any endpoint proof is absent, nominal ready becomes phase=degraded with ready=false and no endpoints. Inactive, starting, and stopping also expose no endpoints. This is not an app-healthcheck."
  - name: docker compose -p PROJECT logs SERVICE|down
    behavior:
      - "Route only a record carrying a known shim profile to typed VAT compose status/log/cleanup operations; generic, missing, and unknown shim provenance fail closed before inspection or mutation."

This ordering makes no claim for descendants that escape the managed child."
      - "Parse and validate the Docker-facing `--` delimiter, but do not forward it: Apple Container receives `container exec CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]`, so an option-looking first command argument stays raw command argv."
  - name: docker compose -p PROJECT exec -T --format json SERVICE -- COMMAND | --format=json
    behavior:
      - "Accept only the two exact JSON forms: the format marker is immediately after -T, SERVICE follows it, and -- is mandatory before a non-empty command. Misordered flags, default TTY, and all other exec flags fail closed."
      - "Hold one same-read known-shim-provenance/exact-unique-ready-MicroVM snapshot through child spawn, parse and validate the literal Docker-facing -- delimiter without forwarding it, invoke Apple Container as container exec CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...], then release the compose claim before arbitrary child wait/drain."
      - "Drain stdout/stderr concurrently and bound each serialized JSON string to 64 KiB. Emit one VAT-native vat.docker-compose.exec.v1 document with profile, child_exit_code, separate streams, truncated/utf8_lossy, runtime_invoked=true, compose_record_mutated=false, no raw child output, and no topology/endpoints; this is not Docker Compose exec output compatibility."
  - name: vat compose import|up|ps|logs|down
    behavior:
      - "Generic vat compose is a separate lifecycle surface and cannot operate a known shim-provenance record; the only transfer is an explicit inactive generic import, which clears known provenance."
      - "Generic import refuses to adopt unknown shim provenance. For an inactive unknown record, vat compose down removes only its registry project.json and leaves vat.toml intact so the user can re-import; it never touches a runtime."
      - "For unknown active provenance, generic cleanup fails closed and directs the user to a matching or newer VAT that recognizes the profile, or to the matching Docker shim."
