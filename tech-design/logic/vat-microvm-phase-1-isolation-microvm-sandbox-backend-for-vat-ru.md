id: vat-microvm-phase-1-isolation-microvm-sandbox-backend-for-vat-ru
summary: Add an additive `Isolation::MicroVm` sandbox backend to `vat run`, built on Apple's `container` CLI, that runs a workload inside an ephemeral microVM and fails closed whenever it cannot satisfy the requested GPU or egress policy. Phase 1 of the microVM epic (#1471); Phase 0 (#1472) already verified the `container` CLI mechanics with a "go" verdict.

    claim: microvm-sandbox-backend-for-vat-run
    coverage: full
    rationale: "Adds the Isolation::MicroVm variant, sandbox/microvm.rs (MicroVmBackend), the fail-closed pick() branch, the run.rs GPU-preflight bug fix (dual fail-closed layer per #1300 precedent), capabilities.rs/doctor.rs probing, and the --microvm-image CLI flag — the complete Phase 1 design for the new MicroVm sandbox backend work root."

additionalProperties: true
```
## CLI
<!-- type: cli lang: yaml -->

```yaml
commands:
  - name: vat run
    behavior:
      - "New flag `--microvm-image <ref>` on Cmd::Run, threaded into the three `EnvSpec { ... }` construction sites in run.rs (~163/334/518) as `microvm_image` (R7). `--isolation micro_vm` is already accepted (Isolation derives clap::ValueEnum); this flag is the only new one."
      - "`sandbox::pick(spec)` gains a fail-closed `Isolation::MicroVm` branch (R3): `GpuRequest::Required` is rejected outright; a missing `microvm_image` is rejected (vat never guesses a base image); `microvm::available()` (container CLI on PATH) is required; `EgressPolicy::Open`/`Deny` are enforced, `EgressPolicy::LocalhostOnly` is rejected with the Phase-0-confirmed gateway-IP reasoning, not a generic 'no bridge' message."
      - "GPU preflight bug fix (R4): the three existing `GpuRequest::Required` checks in run.rs (~163/334/518) now call a shared `gpu_satisfied(gpu, isolation, info)` helper that also factors in isolation mode, so `--isolation micro_vm --gpu required` is rejected before any workspace clone begins \u2014 a second, independent fail-closed layer alongside `pick()`'s own rejection (dual-defense pattern per #1300 precedent)."
      - "For image-backed MicroVm service preparation (the Phase 3 compose path), no new CLI flag is added: `ensure_system_started` uses the bounded `container system status` probe from this backend before `container run`. A hung status process is killed/reaped and deadline expiry fails closed with container-unavailable diagnostics (R11/R12)."
      - "`--isolation none`/`--isolation seatbelt` behavior is unchanged (out of scope)."
  - name: vat capabilities --json
    behavior:
      - "The `vm` row (R5) reports real probing instead of a hardcoded stub: `implemented: true`, `available: sandbox::microvm::available()`, `gpu_native: false` (GPU passthrough is categorically impossible in an Apple Silicon microVM), `network_egress` mirrors `available` (Open/Deny enforceable, LocalhostOnly not), with a reason string naming the LocalhostOnly gap explicitly."
      - "This remains full host discovery and executes its normal Docker daemon probe; it is not the selected-plan optimization used by vat doctor."
      - "Phase A adds `apple_container.builder` as bounded, read-only shared-host evidence: `container builder status --format json` reports `ownership=shared_unknown` and `automatic_cleanup=false`; a parseable configuration is kept distinct from optional live `container stats` observations, while optional `container system df` is marked `global_apple_container`, not VAT-owned disk."
      - "Builder status, stats, and disk probes may be unsupported, malformed, absent, or time out. They record advisory `state`/`probe_errors` without failing `vat capabilities`; a real live state is emitted only when the installed Apple Container CLI supports and returns it. VAT never starts, stops, deletes, or prunes shared builder/cache state."
  - name: vat doctor
    behavior:
      - "`check_network_isolation()` adds `\"vm\"` to its existing OR condition (R6), so a MicroVm-isolated run is recognized as network-isolation-capable on hosts where the `container` CLI is available, consistent with how `seatbelt` is already recognized."
      - "Doctor scopes capability discovery to the selected RunPlan. A plan consisting only of explicit MicroVm image/preset services performs one read-only `container system status` check per invocation and projects it to every selected MicroVm service; it neither autostarts Apple Container nor falls back to Docker, even when Docker is on PATH. Unsupported MicroVm presets without a declared OCI route and MicroVm preset named volumes fail closed rather than choosing Docker."
      - "For that Apple-Container-only selected plan, JSON maps `services.docker_services` to `not_probed` and records `docker.daemon_probe.state=skipped` with the truthful reason `Docker daemon probe skipped for Apple-Container-only selected plan`; that field is provenance for the deliberately skipped probe. `daemon=false` is not Docker-unavailable evidence because no Docker command ran. An unselected Docker service cannot affect the selected MicroVm runner; a full Docker probe maps services.docker_services to available or unavailable."
      - "Doctor surfaces the shared-builder record only as a successful advisory check. A bounded builder-status/stats/disk timeout, unknown state, or probe error never changes Apple Container runtime success or the doctor exit result."
      - "Doctor retains the normal Docker daemon probe whenever the selected plan has a Docker-runtime service, an Auto image service, an eligible Auto preset Docker fallback, or a cluster; a selected cluster needs its Docker backend."
