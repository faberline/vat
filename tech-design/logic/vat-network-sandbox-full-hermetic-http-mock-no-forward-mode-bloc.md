id: vat-network-sandbox-full-hermetic-http-mock-no-forward-mode-bloc
summary: Add a no-forward (hermetic) mode to vat's http-mock proxy so an unmatched request returns a clear blocked error instead of forwarding to the real upstream — auto-enabled when [network].egress is localhost-only/deny, so the runner's seatbelt egress confinement plus a non-forwarding proxy make a vat run fully hermetic (fail-closed, can't reach the real internet) while routes/stubs/openapi/cassette-replays still work.

    claim: local-agent-test-runner-protocol
    coverage: partial
    rationale: "Egress confinement (#518/#527) confines the runner but the un-sandboxed http-mock proxy still forwards unmatched requests to the internet; a no-forward mode closes that escape hatch, completing the hermetic sandbox."

## Schema
<!-- type: schema lang: yaml -->

```yaml
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
$id: "vat-hermetic-proxy.schema.json"
title: "http-mock forward policy"
type: object
properties:
  forward:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: "true = current (forward unmatched to real upstream + record). false = hermetic: unmatched returns 502 blocked, no upstream connection, no cassette write."
  blocked_response:
    type: object
    description: "The hermetic miss response."
    properties:
      status: { type: integer, const: 502 }

  unaffected:
    type: array
    items: { type: string }
    description: "route, stub, openapi, cassette-replay still serve in no-forward mode; only forward+record is disabled. Non-routed h2/gRPC already 502s."
additionalProperties: true
```

## Config
<!-- type: config lang: yaml -->

```yaml
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
$id: "vat-config-hermetic.schema.json"
title: "egress-derived hermetic proxy"
type: object
properties:
  derivation:
    type: string
    description: "vat run passes --no-forward to the http-mock spawn when [network].egress is localhost-only or deny; open keeps forwarding. No separate vat.toml key — one knob (egress) yields full hermeticity."
additionalProperties: true
```

## CLI
<!-- type: cli lang: yaml -->

```yaml
commands:
  - name: vat emulator http-mock
    usage: "vat emulator http-mock --host-port <hp> --ca-path <p> --cassette-dir <d> [--route ...] [--no-forward]"
    behavior:
      - "--no-forward puts the proxy in hermetic mode: an unmatched request (after route/stub/openapi/cassette miss) returns 502 {\"error\":\"hermetic: ...; forwarding disabled\"} instead of forwarding to the real upstream or writing a cassette."
      - "Without --no-forward, forwarding+recording is unchanged."
  - name: vat run
    behavior:
      - "Spawns the http-mock proxy with --no-forward when [network].egress is localhost-only or deny — so the runner (seatbelt-confined to localhost) plus a non-forwarding proxy make the run hermetic. egress=open keeps the proxy forwarding."
```
